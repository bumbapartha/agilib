# agilib
agilib controls SDLC phases with different tools Like Mock-up/Prototyping Tool, 
Cost Estimation Tool, Version Control System, Collaborative Tool,  Issue Logger etc

# Goal

Create a collaborative interface which will handle complete SDLC process under one umbrella using the following tools.

1. Create a Collaborative Platform named agilib (Concept of Facebook Pages and Chlid Pages, User Dashboard, Notifcations etc.) which will bring customer, project manager, developer (along with third party developer), testers, maintenance team in a single platform. (We are considering diaspora as this platform https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora)
2. Create or find an open source Prototyping/Mock-up tool that can be used inside this agilib. So that customer or designers can visually design the requirement and express those in text also, which can be directly published to agilib.
3. Create or find an open source Cost estimation tool which can use popular cost estimation technique like COCOMO, FPA etc, which can be directly published to agilib (of course role/user wise access restriction will be there).
4. Create or find an open source private Git server which can be used by developers and commit information will be published to agilib. Agilib user (role/user bases access required) can review those modifications.
5. Create or find an open source build toll which will build the code and make ready a deploy able version. Those deploy able version will also be checked in Private Git repository. Notification will be published on agilib.
6. Create or find an open source issue tracking system in which testers will log defect/issue. Creating or updating, closing those issues will be published on agilib as well.
7. All those above toll will have only Single Sign on and should behave like one single application.

  More details coming soon.
